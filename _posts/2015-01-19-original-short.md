description: "This is a short piece that explores the concept of originality. The topic is full of wonder, conflict, excitement, and subjectivity. For many, originality means drawing inspiration from a variety of sources to create a new idea. The script for \"Original\" is meant to be an adaptation of this belief; proving that unique ideas can be inspired by existing concepts, objects and experiences."
