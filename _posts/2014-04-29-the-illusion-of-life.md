  The 12 basic principles of animation were developed by the 'old men' of Walt
  Disney Studios, amongst them Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, during the
  1930s. Of course they weren't old men at the time, but young men who were at
  the forefront of exciting discoveries that were contributing to the
  development of a new art form.
